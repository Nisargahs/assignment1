# assignment1

i have done this project using python and tkinter(for GUI).
i have imported message box and tk from tkinter package(GUI-graphical user interface purpose) 
imported random package to generate random digits or alphabets or special characters (backend) to generate password. 
created function called password_generator in that passlen(how many characters should  is variable it takes integer input from user , here i have assumed minimum 4 charcters should be there, if not it is considered as invalid).
i have considered only these many special characters (@#$%^&*!?).
